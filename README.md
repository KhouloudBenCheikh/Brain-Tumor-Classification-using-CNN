# Brain-Tumor-Classification-using-CNN
AI model equipped with advanced deep learning technology and specifically designed using 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect Brain Tumors in MRI images with high accuracy. 
The development process leveraged TensorFlow and OpenCV, two well-known open-source libraries 
in the field of Machine Learning and Computer Vision. 
The CNN architecture has been trained on a comprehensive Dataset of MRI images,
enabling it to recognize the unique features associated with brain tumors.
